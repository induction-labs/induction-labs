# This is really stupid - if we try to start ray with the default LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# that is set by uv managed by devenv, then we get /home/ubuntu/documents/induction-labs/repos/modeling/.devenv/state/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/ray/core/src/ray/gcs/gcs_server: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.36' not found (required by /nix/store/7n3q3rgy5382di7ccrh3r6gk2xp51dh7-gcc-14.2.1.20250322-lib/lib/libstdc++.so.6)
# because it tries to use the glibc from the venv, which is not compatible with the system glibc.
# So we need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the system glibc and gcc libraries
# I'm not sure why other libraries like numpy and torch work with nix LD_LIBRARY_PATH but ray doesn't,
# I think it is related to ray starting subprocesses that need to link against the system glibc and gcc libraries.
