You will be given a two versions of the same screenshot. You're job is to identify the UI element the cursor is hovering over in the screenshot. 
The first image is in grayscale with the cursor highlighted with a red circle. This image is to help you locate the element.
The second is the original with no red circle and full color. 


Your have three tasks:
1. Locate the cursor.
2. Determine if the mouse action interacts with a distinct, identifiable UI element.
3. If the cursor is on a UI element, describe the element and its location in the screenshot.

## Task 1: Locate the Cursor

First, use the first image to LOCATE THE CURSOR IN THE RED CIRCLE. Take note of what is around it so you can find it in the second image.
If you cannot find the cursor, simply return `{is_distinct_element: false}` and you are finished.

## Task 2: Decide whether there is a distinct, identifiable UI element.

Then, cross reference with the second image and the location information from the first image to determine what is the element in the red circle. Look for similar visual landmarks between the two images around the cursor. 
Note that the red circle is not part of the original screenshot, it is added to help you focus on the clicked point. DO NOT reference the red circle in your response.
Mark `is_distinct_element: true` **ONLY** when the cursor is clearly directed at a specific, identifiable UI element, such as:
- Clicking a button, link, or menu item
- Selecting a text field or checkbox
- Dragging an item to a specific location

If the cursor is on empty space, or if you cannot locate the cursor in the screenshot, mark `is_distinct_element: false`.

## Task 3: Describe the UI element.
If you marked the cursor as on a distinct UI element, write a clear, concise description of the element and its location in the screenshot.
For example:
`The "Kitchen" option from the Category dropdown in the top left corner of the screen.`""".strip()

# Instruction
You will be given a screenshot of a user's mouse action, along with their reasoning for taking this action.

You then have three tasks:
1. Decide whether the user is clicking on a distinct, identifiable UI element.
2. If the mouse action is a useful action, write a simple instruction that would result in the mouse action shown in the screenshot.
3. In addition, if the mouse action is useful, rewrite the user's reasoning to focus only on the present action.

## Task 1: Decide whether the mouse action is useful.
Mark `useful_action: true` **ONLY** when the user's click or drag action is clearly directed at a specific, identifiable UI element, such as:
- Clicking a button, link, or menu item
- Selecting a text field or checkbox
- Dragging an item to a specific location

## Task 2: Write a *simple* instruction that would result in the behaviour shown in the screenshots.
If you marked the action as useful, write a clear, concise instruction that an AI assistant could follow to replicate the observed behavior. Good instructions should be unambiguous and limited to a single sentence of a few words. The instruction should describe *what to do*, not *how to do it*, for example "Change the orientation to landscape" is better than "Click the button in the top right corner to change the orientation to landscape."

If the action is not useful, simply write `action_instruction: "NOT USEFUL."` followed by a short explanation of why it is not useful.


## Task 3: Rewrite the user's reasoning.
If you marked the action as useful, rewrite the user's reasoning to focus **only** on the present action. Remove any references to past actions or future plans. When referencing elements on the screen, include their position in the screenshot, e.g., "the button in the top right corner" or "the text field in the middle of the screen". 
The user's reasoning should loosely follow the format (feel free to reword, but keep the structure):

```
My goal is [briefly restate the goal of the action]. I notice that [describe the relevant elements on the screen, including their position]. Therefore, I [describe the action taken, e.g., "clicked the button in the top right corner"].

Here's an example of the style I'm looking for:
### Instruction: Change the calculation mode to "manual" in excel.>

### Reasoning:
My current goal is to select the "manual" calculation mode in Excel. I noticed that the dropdown menu for the calculation options is already open in the top right of the screen, and it includes the "Manual" option that I need. This is exactly what I was looking for, so I'll go ahead and click on it to switch to manual calculation mode.
