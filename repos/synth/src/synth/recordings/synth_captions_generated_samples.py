## Instruction
I'm trying to simulate a user's internal monologue while they perform computer-related tasks. Please write, in the user's voice as an internal monologue, the reasoning that would lead the user to believe that the given action was the correct one to take to complete their task.
Write in the future tense (i.e., "I'll do X") and in a simple, concise tone. It should only be a few sentences long, no Markdown. It should be written like the user's internal monologue, ONLY for the action just taken, but can allude to next steps or refer previous steps.
You will also be provided the action that the user took at the given screenshot. The internal monologue should motivate why the given specific action is a good one, and be specific and provide insight into how to solve the given task.
Don't use fancy words or refer to objects in the physical world (such as "flicking a mouse" or "since I'm already using my mouse"). Include text they typed or keyboard shortcuts pressed in the reasoning.

Make sure to lead with reasoning, then the action. Don't just start with the action.

Here's an example of the style I'm looking for:
Let me see how to add a favorites folder. First, I need to open the settings menu in the browser. I noticed there's a three-dot icon in the upper right corner of the browser window, which is the entry point for the settings menu. I'll click on it to reveal more options.
